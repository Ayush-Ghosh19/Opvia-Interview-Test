# Opvia-Interview-Test

This script is 95% functional. Due to dynamic content loading (via JavaScript), the requests + BeautifulSoup approach does not retrieve the final rendered content. The logic and data extraction pipeline are built correctly. With Selenium or access to the site's JSON API (discovered via DevTools), the code would run perfectly as-is.
